# Expressive Mechanics (continued)

This week I continued to work on the expressive mechanics project (see previous week's journal for more details).
</br>

## Electronics
Incorporating DC motor (fritz)
Tried to use motor library
Switch to analogwrite
Video with arms and laser cut pieces attached

## Fabrication
Trying the crank and slider (under the box)
Show that I tried different arm lengths and size ratios
Considering rack and pinion
(intermission for lost wallet)
Makeshift proof of concept for presentation, deciding to go with the paper airplane
Switching to cam-piston/dwell mechanism based on presentation feedback
Cardboard box prototype
Final

## Reflection
