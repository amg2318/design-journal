## Emotive Origami Project

As soon as I read the brief for this project, I wanted to try to use the [Japanese Tato box](https://youtu.be/urDWQM2gV6c?si=_Dme3z4LiOegoztX) that I've been making since I was a kid. My mom would use patterned origami paper to make these boxes and put a small candy within as a treat when I was little, so I want to try to replicate the excitement I had when opening them. The idea is for the box to open and unfurl when a hand reaches for it. 

Here's (video) what it looks like: picture at rest (closed), picture open (must be held)
