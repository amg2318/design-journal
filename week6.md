# Expressive Mechanics Project

For the next two weeks, we have been assigned the [expressive mechanics project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwybCpWlqz64tKHli3nwZz0LOl2eumrLExoOhAn2S7s/edit?tab=t.0):

>Design and construct a kinetic mechanism that captivates the audience through wonderment. Your mechanism should respond to live camera input using computer vision and machine learning, translating visual information into expressive movement. The goal is to explore how mechanical systems can interact with and react to their environment in surprising, engaging ways.
You will use machine learning algorithms in p5.js to process camera input and send serial messages to an Arduino Uno, which will control motors that animate your mechanism.
>
>Input: Camera input processed with machine learning in p5.js
>
>Output: DC motor motion controlled via Arduino
>
>Interaction: The relationship between camera input and movement should be perceivable and meaningful to the viewer

After much brainstorming, I decided on a concept inspired by the series of comics about Snoopy and the Red Baron (see below). The idea was that a laser cut version of Snoopy on his dog house would be bobbing up in down in the air and people who walked up to the camera could control the tilt of the dog house, giving the illusion of the person controlling how Snoopy flies.

Based on this idea, I created a diagram of the system:

## Electronics

getting the tutorial working
inspired by skeleton example
getting it to work with my arms instead
added a smidge of smoothing

## Fabrication

drew out the concept based on learnings from the last project
was recommended to pivot to crank and slider
make cardboard version
laser cut pieces
show manipulating it with my hands
