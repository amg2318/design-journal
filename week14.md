# Final Project (continued)

This week we continued to work our concept for the final project, taking measurements and modeling our form in Fusion. It was Thanksgiving break so we only have one entry this week.

## Fusion design and modeling

In order to figure out the form, we had to measure all the electronic parts as well as the minimum size for the "object space" and the optimal distance between the "object space" and the camera. Once that was done, we experimented with button and dial layout, taking inspiration from existing keypads but also laying it out and testing it in person:

</br>
</br>
We also aligned on a chunkier form that felt more in the direction of Fisher Price toys and Teenage Engineering music devices rather than lamps or some of our other sources of inspiration.

</br>
The big empty section in the model above is where the buttons and dials would go. We decided to give more space for the natural objects to make room for bigger pinecones, clusters of pineneedles, and leaves. We also explored more rounded arms to support the camera:

</br>
</br>
We decided we liked it more rectangular instead for aesthetics and ease of 3D printing. This final version also made the sections modular since it was too big to print in one go on the Bambu printers and would be easier to transport in pieces.

With the fusion files complete, we went it off to get printed on Chris Myer's personal Bambu and went on Thanksgiving break.
