This week's electronics prompt is:
> Do "something interesting" with 1+ LEDS and 1 LDR. 

Upon finishing the overview tutorial, I first experimented with including a second LED that lit at lower sensor readings and the original at higher sensor readings, each at a brightness reflective of the strength of light read by the LDR.

Code:
```
void setup() {
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.print("Analog IN A0 value = ");
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  if (sensorValue >= 50) {
    analogWrite(9, sensorValue);
    digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  } else {
    analogWrite(11, sensorValue/10);
    digitalWrite(9, LOW);
  }
  delay(100);
}
```
