# Emotive Origami Project

This week the main focus is the [emotive origami project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cw4nj2my8vcnbyRD-siceU4XP0ueKQAaXggEdhvWza0/edit?usp=sharing):
> Using your knowledge of Arduino, sensors, and servo control, design and build a unique moving sculpture that communicates a specific emotion.  The goal is to have a kinetic art piece that communicates an emotion and captivates the viewer. The sculpture should respond to user interaction through sensor input, producing meaningful motion that expresses the chosen emotion.
>
> Input: Sensor data collected and processed by a microcontroller
>
> Output: Actuator (e.g., servo) motion driven by the processed data
>
> Interaction: The sensor-to-motion relationship should be clear and understandable

As soon as I read the brief, I wanted to try to use the [Japanese Tato box](https://youtu.be/urDWQM2gV6c?si=_Dme3z4LiOegoztX) that I've been making since I was a kid. My mom would use patterned origami paper to make these boxes and put a small candy within as a treat when I was little, so I want to try to replicate the excitement I had when opening them. The idea is for the box to open and unfurl when a hand reaches for it. 

Here's (video) what it looks like: picture at rest (closed), picture open (must be held)

## Electronics: Servo and Ultrasonic
