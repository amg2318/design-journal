I had a lot of issues getting the same code for the button to work, but the potentiometer worked fine. I also managed to get the servo! So, to experiment I decided I would try to combine the RGB LED, potentiometer and the servo. The goal was to have the potentiometer control the servo movement as well as which color was showing on the RGB LED.
